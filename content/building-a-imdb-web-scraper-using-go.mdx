## Welcome all to my homage 🛖

Hi fellows, I have been learning about web scrapers these days and saw there is no many articles on Go itself on [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/search?q=golang) and building a scraper with it is far away. So I thought about let's build a simple cli tool which will take birthday as input and crawl a tiny part of the website [IMDB](https://imdb.com/search/name) to look for celebrities who born on that date and stores various data into a file `outputs/mm-dd.json` inside output directory.

If you do not know about IMDB, it is a website which contains information about movies, TV shows, and celebrities. It is a very popular website and has a huge database of information. So, it is a good place to start learning about web scraping.

As you might not know, building a web scraper consists of four main steps :
1. **Crawling** : Crawling is the process of finding all the links on a website and adding them to a queue.
2. **Scraping** : Scraping is the process of extracting data from a website.
3. **Parsing** : Parsing is the process of converting the raw data into a structured format.
4. **Storing** : Storing is the process of saving the data into a file or database.

And we will look deep into all of them step by step, so sit tight and let's get started.

## Prerequisites 👩🏻‍🏫
- [**Go**](https://go.dev/)
- [**JSON**](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp)

> And also you should have basic knowledge of **crawlers** and **scrapers** in general. [Learn here](https://oxylabs.io/blog/crawling-vs-scraping)


## Let us begin then ⚡️


### 1. Project Setup

At first, Create a directory and make a `main.go` file inside and open terminal in that directory to command :

```zsh
go mod init github.com/sarkartanmay/IMBD-Scraper-Golang
```


![Screenshot 2022-10-20 at 5.28.46 PM.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1666267177175/NkgQw4hIw.png align="left")



I am using my GitHub repo link in my module name as a convention, so you should change that to your desired module name. E.g. `github.com/username/project-name` and you can learn more about [Modules in Go](https://go.dev/blog/using-go-modules) here.


Then, install [colly](http://go-colly.org/) by commanding in terminal :

```zsh
go get github.com/gocolly/colly
```

And this is how our project setup is done, let us now go straight into coding our web scraper.


### 2. Coding the Scraper
I hope as you write the code, your code editor will import the packages that are necessary.
And with that, let us start coding our scraper.

First, we will make a customized structs that will hold our scraped data in program memory. We will make a struct for each type of data we want to scrape. For example, we will make a struct for each celebrity and a struct for each movie.

```go
️// ⭐ Star holds a celebrety's name and other imdb information.
type Star struct {
    Name      string  `json:"name"`
    Photo     string  `json:"photo"`
    JobTitle  string  `json:"job_title"`
    Birthdate string  `json:"birthdate"`
    Bio       string  `json:"bio"`
    TopMovies []Movie `json:"top_movies"`
}

// 🎦 Movie holds basic information about a movie.
type Movie struct {
    Title   string `json:"title"`
    Release string `json:"release"`
}
```

This is our two structures that will hold our scraped data. We will use the [json](https://pkg.go.dev/encoding/json) package to convert our data into JSON format. We will use the `json` tag to specify the name of the key in the JSON object, and to tell Go that when we convert our struct into a JSON object, it must name them as we specified in the `json` tag.

> For example, the `Name` field in the `Star` struct will be converted to the `name` key and `TopMovies` to `top_movies` in the JSON object.

Now, we will create function that will take two parameters (day, month) to crawl into IMDB with specified date and return scraped data in a slice of stars `[]stars` ✨.

```go
// 🕷 Crawl crawls the imdb website for a given page and returns a list of stars.
func Crawl(month int, day int) []Star {
    
    // stars will hold all the scraped data.
    var stars []Star
    
    // Collectors are used to scrape data from a website.
    // Main collector instance is initialized here.
    // Our main collector c will only look for profile links of celebreties
    // and go on next pages if there is next button on current page.
    c := colly.NewCollector(
        // Colly collector will only visit the given domains.
        colly.AllowedDomains("www.imdb.com", "imdb.com"),
        // Colly collector stores cache and uses from here.
        colly.CacheDir("./.imdb_cache"),
        // Cache is disabled by default, so we need to enable it.
    )
    
    // ic stands for Info Collector, is just cloned from main collector.
    // This collector will be used to scrape data from the info page.
    // It will go inside a profile link and look for data in that only.
    // This collector will be on work everytime main collector find a new profile link.
    ic := c.Clone()
    
    // Where crawler sees 'mode-detail' class attribute, it will call back the function.
    c.OnHTML(".mode-detail", func(e *colly.HTMLElement) {
        // Getting the profile url from the href attribute, it is goquery selector string.
        // 'div.lister-item-image > a' is path of profile url in HTML.
        // At fist there is a Div tag with class 'lister-item-image' and
        // inside that there is a tag 'a' where href attribute is profile url.
        profileUrl := e.ChildAttr("div.lister-item-image > a", "href")
        // But the profile url is relative, so we need to add the base url.
        // profileUrl is "/name/nm0000123/" corrently.
        profileUrl = e.Request.AbsoluteURL(profileUrl)
        // Now profileUrl is "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000123/".
        
        // Asking info collector to visit the profile url.
        ic.Visit(profileUrl)
    })
    
    // This crawler function gets into next page, if there is one.
    // On IMDB, there is a button with text 'Next' on each page with
    // class 'lister-page-next next-page' and we are looking only for that.
    c.OnHTML("a.lister-page-next", func(e *colly.HTMLElement) {
        // Getting the next page url from the href attribute.
        nextPageUrl := e.Attr("href")
        nextPageUrl = e.Request.AbsoluteURL(nextPageUrl)
        
        // Asking main collector to visit the next page url.
        c.Visit(nextPageUrl)
    })
    
    // This info collector crawler function gets the information of the celebrety inside the 'profileURL' page.
    ic.OnHTML("#content-2-wide", func(e *colly.HTMLElement) {
        
        // Getting all details using info collector and storing them in a Star struct.
        temporaryStar := Star{
            Name:      e.ChildText("h1.header > span.itemprop"),
            Photo:     e.ChildAttr("#name-poster", "src"),
            JobTitle:  e.ChildText("#name-job-categories > a > span.itemprop"),
            Birthdate: e.ChildAttr("#name-born-info > time", "datetime"),
            Bio:       strings.TrimSpace(e.ChildText("#name-bio-text > div.name-trivia-bio-text > div.inline")),
            TopMovies: []Movie{},
        }
        
        // Now iterating over all the top movies of the profile url page.
        e.ForEach("div.knownfor-title", func(_ int, el *colly.HTMLElement) {
            temporaryStar.TopMovies = append(temporaryStar.TopMovies, Movie{
                Title:   el.ChildText("div.knownfor-title-role > a.knownfor-ellipsis"),
                Release: el.ChildText("div.knownfor-title > div.knownfor-year > span.knownfor-ellipsis"),
            })
        })
        
        // Now appending the temporaryStar to the stars slice.
        stars = append(stars, temporaryStar)
    })
    
    // Printing text of every request made on info collector.
    ic.OnRequest(func(r *colly.Request) {
        fmt.Println("Visiting:\t", r.URL.String())
    })
    
    // Our link to crawl with user specified date and month.
    startUrl := fmt.Sprintf("https://www.imdb.com/search/name/?birth_monthday=%d-%d", month, day)
    fmt.Println("Starting crawling into\t", startUrl)
    
    // Starting the main collector.
    c.Visit(startUrl)
    
    // Returning all the scraped data in a slice of stars.
    return stars
}
```

If you are overwhelmed by the code, don't worry. As I always write lots of comments in code, if you read them, you will understand what is going on.

Let's break down one important part of scraping.

- ### HTML Structure Recognition and Query String 🧵🔎️

Q. How we can recognize the HTML structure of a website ?

A. There are two ways to do that. One is to use the browser's developer tools manually and the other is to use the [colly](gocally.com) package's `InspectElement` function.

I like the first one, manually going through web pages and finding the HTML elements. Searching in HTML is kind of a skill itself, you need to know how to find the right element in HTML.

Let us see how we do that ?

%[https://youtu.be/rL07q10eo0Q]

> Here is video that I made for you to understand how to find right HTML component of a website using query strings.


Now, we can go further into the code. Let us now deal with the `[]Star` slice that we are returning from the `Crawl` function.

```go
// main takes two arguments, month and day. 
// Parse them into integers and call Crawl function.
// Crawl function returns a slice of stars.
// That slice is converted into JSON object.
// And then writes the object into a file.
func main() {

	// Printing prompt for user to input values.
	var input string
	// User should type just like this. e.g.. 12-23
	fmt.Println("Type a date and month in (MM-DD) format:\t")
	_, err := fmt.Scanf("%s", &input)
	if err != nil { // Error handling
		// Fatalln will print the error and exit the program.
		log.Fatalln("Unable to read input because\t", err)
	}

	// Splitting the input into month and day.
	sliceOfInput := strings.Split(input, "-")

	// Converting the month into integer.
	month, err := strconv.Atoi(sliceOfInput[0])
	if err != nil { 
		log.Fatalln("Unable to convert month into int because\t", err)
	}
	// Converting the month into integer.
	day, err := strconv.Atoi(sliceOfInput[1])
	if err != nil { 
		log.Fatalln("Unable to convert date into int because\t", err)
	}

	// Crawling the website with the given month and day and stores the data into a slice of Star.
	// Calling Crawl func with month and day.
	// Storing the returned slice of Star into stars variable.
	stars := Crawl(month, day)

	// To print all the scraped data in terminal.
	// This code part is commented out, because it is not necessary.
	// You can play with it to show the scraped data on terminal.
	// encoder := json.NewEncoder(os.Stderr)
	// encoder.SetIndent("", "   ")
	// err := encoder.Encode(stars)

	// Converting Star struct into JSON.
	data, err := json.MarshalIndent(stars, "", "\t")
	if err != nil {
		log.Println("Error while marshalling JSON: ", err)
	}

	// Writing JSON into a file called 'mm-dd.json'.
	// file name will vary according to the month and day.
	// We are using os pkg to write the file.
	fileName := fmt.Sprintf("%s.json", input)
	err = os.WriteFile(fmt.Sprintf("./outputs/%s", fileName), data, 0644)
	if err != nil {
		if err.Error() == "open ./outputs/12-23.json: no such file or directory" {
			log.Println("Making directory named outputs.")
			os.Mkdir("./outputs", 0755) // making a directory.
			err := os.WriteFile(fmt.Sprintf("./outputs/%s", fileName), data, 0644)
			if err == nil {
				log.Fatalln("Web is scraped and JSON file is created.")
			}
		}
		log.Fatalln("Error while writing JSON: ", err)
	}
	log.Println("Web is scraped and JSON file is created.")
}

// This is where our code ends.
```

### 3. Testing our Scraper

Now, we run our program to test it. We will run it with the date and month of my birthday. So, I will run the `main.go` then type `12-23` and hit enter.

## Conclusion :
This was a simple yet interesting scraper project. We scraped the IMDB website and got the data of all the celebrities who were born on the same day as me. We used [colly](http://go-colly.org/) package to scrape the website. We also used the `os` package to write the scraped data into a file.

Before getting hands-on with Argo CD, we are going to discuss What Argo CD is, How it works, and What prerequisites you need.


###  What is Argo CD ?

Argo CD is a Kubernetes-native continuous deployment (CD) tool. Unlike external CD tools that only enable push-based deployments, Argo CD can pull updated code from Git repositories and deploy it directly to Kubernetes resources. It enables developers to manage both infrastructure configuration and application updates in one system.


Argo CD offers the following key features and capabilities:

- Manual or automatic deployment of applications to a Kubernetes cluster.
- Automatic synchronization of application state to the current version of declarative configuration.
- Web user interface and command-line interface (CLI).
- Ability to visualize deployment issues, detect and remediate configuration drift.
- Role-based access control (RBAC) enables multi-cluster management.
- Single sign-on (SSO) with providers such as GitLab, GitHub, Microsoft, OAuth2, OIDC, LinkedIn, LDAP, and SAML 2.0
- Support for webhooks triggering actions in GitLab, GitHub, and BitBucket.

With fewer words, we can say Argo CD is a GitOps agent that maintains the desired state of a cluster.

Let me explain, suppose there is an application you built, and you want it to run on a cluster with 3 Pods and 2 Services for external IPs. This is the desired state you want and whenever changes happen in your application's repository or if at any moment, your desired state is not present in that cluster, you need to check and do some changes to the cluster to get your desired state running, this is a manual process.
And here comes Argo CD to automate the whole process with GitOps principles where we use Git as the data provider of that application and cluster state.

### How does Argo CD work ?
As we know, Agro CD ensures that the cluster is running in the desired state at all times. 
Then a question rises **how does it work then ?** 

It's simple, there will be two repositories, one holding the application you build and the other one holding the declaratively written desired state of the cluster. Argo CD as a Kubernetes controller can be installed in the same cluster where our application is or it can also perform its tasks from an external cluster. It checks whether the current state of the running cluster matches with the written desired state, if it doesn't then Argo CD will try to make the desired state and synchronize everything.



![argocd_architecture.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1660817332734/7yMiDqI0E.png align="left")
For a better understanding of its architecture, visit [Argo CD Documentation](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/architecture/).


When Argo CD checks that the live and desired states are different, it shows `OutOfSync` in its UI, yes it does have a UI as well as CLI, whatever you wish to use. And if it matches then Everything is fine, its status return Synced.

It supports plain Kubernetes manifests, Helm charts, Kustomize definitions, and other templating mechanisms.

By default, Argo CD looks for any changes in our repository every 3 minutes. If there are any changes in our repositories, Argo CD will update our cluster with the new changes we desired.
But if we want Argo CD to look for changes every second, we can do that too and if you don't like this mechanism of checking for changes then you can use [webhooks](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/about-webhooks) too where Argo CD receives notifications from your git provider and when it receives a notification from your application's repo, it will look for changes.

Check core concepts of Argo CD from this link [core-concepts](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/core_concepts/).

## Prerequisites
1. Basic knowledge of Git, K8s, and [Networking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPvYjXCsTg8&list=PL9gnSGHSqcnoqBXdMwUTRod4Gi3eac2Ak&index=3).
2. Tools - [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/), [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) (*optional*), [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/) (*optional*).

## Implementation of Argo CD

- **Q. What will we be doing today ?**
- **A. Deploy a Docker application in a Kubernetes cluster which is declaratively described in plain Kubernetes manifest files in a Github Repo.**

In this article, I have used this repo [Webserver-CI-CD-Golang](https://github.com/sarkartanmay393/Webserver-CI-CD-Golang)

> For this demo, I am using Minikube for a local cluster. Or you can create your Argo CD setup in [Codefresh Course](https://codefresh.learnworlds.com/course/gitops-with-argo).


- ** Installation of Argo CD **

Argo CD can be used to deploy and manage other applications, do not forget that it is also an application by itself. There are many ways to install it on a Kubernetes cluster.

For the experiment, You can deploy Argo CD by directly using the manifest,
```
kubectl create namespace argocd
kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml
``` 
For a production setup, we suggest you use [Autopilot](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-autopilot), a companion project that not only installs Argo CD but commits all configuration to git so Argo CD can manage itself using GitOps.

For more traditional installation options, the manifests directory offers different modes of installation with or without High Availability. The installs marked as "namespace" allow you to install Argo CD on a single namespace without cluster-wide privileges. This is best when you want to install Argo CD on one cluster but have it manage other external clusters.

See all resources created by Argo CD -
```
kubectl get all -n argocd
``` 
![argocd-resources.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1660766894705/sxzGvrIIS.png align="left")

- ** Expose Argo CD UI **

By default, Argo CD is only accessible from within the cluster. To expose the UI you can utilize any of the standard Kubernetes networking mechanisms such as -
1. Ingress (recommended for production)
2. Load balancer (affects cloud cost)
3. NodePort (simple but not very flexible)


Once the external URL is ready, you need to decide how users will access the Argo CD UI. There are mainly two approaches:
1. Use a small number of local users. Authentication is handled by Argo CD itself. Best for very small companies (e.g. 2-5 people).
2. Use an SSO provider. Authentication is handled by the provider. Ideal for companies and large organizations.

To expose using Ingress,

```
kubectl port-forward svc/argocd-server -n argocd 8085:443
``` 

Now, visit https://localhost:8085 for Argo CD UI.


For admin username and password,
Open another tab in the terminal and command -
```
kubectl -n argocd get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 -d > admin-pass.txt
``` 
![admin-password.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1660772640595/fPyIjEare.png align="left")

Now, login to the admin account -

- ** Creating and Syncing Application in Argo CD  **

An application can be created in Argo CD from the UI, CLI, or by writing a Kubernetes manifest that can then be passed to kubectl to create resources.

```zsh
argocd app create demo-app --project default --repo https://github.com/sarkartanmay393/Sample-GO-WebApp --path . --dest-namespace default --dest-server https://kubernetes.default.svc
```
This will be output -

```bash
➜  argocd app sync demo-app    #Sync demo-app

Now the deployed application is synced.


This will be the final view of our deployed application in the Argo CD User Interface.

- ** Access the Deployed App **


Now check for services running under `default` namespace in kubernetes.
Run the command - 
```bash
➜ kubectl get services    #Get cluster services under default namespace.

NAME             TYPE        CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
kubernetes       ClusterIP   10.96.0.1     <none>        443/TCP          40d
sample-service   NodePort    10.96.22.35   <none>        8080:31000/TCP   17m
```
You need to port forward the `sample-service` to access the app.
Run the command -
```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/sample-service 8086:8080
```
Now, visit http://localhost:8086 to see.

PS. Learning About Agro CD from [Codefresh](https://codefresh.learnworlds.com/course/gitops-with-argo).
For this article, I have taken references from Codefresh.
